45881,"Rand was a good guy, really... he was. But I felt he had an alter-ego when he left to go home and grade. His expectations and how he picked apart his students papers was simply not fair. Again, great guy but avoid this class with him!!!",awful
45881,"He is brilliant in his field, but expects his students to perform at high levels, with unrealistic expectations. Only by a miracle did I get an A, and that was after a heavy curve. He does care about his students though, as he gives lots of time in class for work, while he goes around giving tips and answering questions.",poor
45881,"He has a major in philosophy which is why all the papers you have to write are based on philosophy. As long as your paper agrees with what he thinks you will get a good grade. Otherwise the class is boring and he talks for an hour about nonsense but it is mandatory to attend otherwise your grade will drop.",awful
45881,"I thought his class was extremely hard but despite it all, I became a confident writer. People on here say 'you can only get a c on a paper' WRONG. I got an A and a B. You just have to be in it to win it. If you want to get an A, get a different teacher. If you want learn, Go for Rand. He made Eng. 110 worth something.",good
45881,"I recently just finished taking Comp 110 with Rand and it was the hardest class of my freshman semester. He takes it way too serious for a 100 level class. 80% of the class is papers so you would think you control the grade you get, right? Wrong.  He will tear apart your paper and give you a bad grade despite your efforts. I worked hard for a C.",poor
45881,"Steven Rand is a nice person and really interesting to hear him speak. I am always inspired after a lecture. However, never expect to get anything higher than a C. You can think your paper is perfect but, he will tear it apart in seconds. Take a different professor if you don't want to put 9 hours of work into a paper you get an 'average' grade on.",good
45881,"Hard class ",good
45881,"He graded a 100 level class like we were all English majors in a 300 or above level class. Never got higher than a C on a paper. I went to the writing center for every paper. Very unclear in instructions and hard to approach with questions. Don't take the class from him.",awful
45881,"Tough grader on papers make sure you do your work and drafts. Participation grades save you in the long run. Dont miss class and do your work. Go to the tutor center helps alot",poor
45881,"Do not take English 110 with Rand. I don't feel any better at writing due to his confusing grading style. ",poor
45881,"Bottom line Rand needs to retire before he ruins everyone's GPA's.  He thinks he knows so much about English and thinks it is his job to make essay assignments unneeded riddles.  He answers questions with questions and likes to talk trash about high school English teachers; hating on the high school teachers ironically makes it like high school. FR",awful
45881,"He will only give your paper a C. It does not matter if it is good or not. Work extremely hard if you plan on passing.",good
45881,"one of the worst professors at UND. Extremely hard grader and expects to much in a 100 level class. Thinks that everyone's papers should be masterpieces. No matter how long i spent on a paper i couldnt get higher than a C. Only reason i got a B in the class was because i never missed a class. ",awful
45881,"This class is so pointless its ridiculous.  I'm in the class currently (only because its required.) The class has no relevance to anything in life.  Rand is a ****, the class is so boring. He could make the class so much better by writing papers that actually have meaning to  them instead of what some philosopher said.  Textbook reading is hard!!  ",awful
45881,"Horrible professor. He does not believe in A's.  Thinks that other teachers grade too easily.  Answers your questions with other questions that do not help you.  Teaches you irrelevant material that you will never use again. Worst professor I have ever had.",awful
45881,"Worst professor ever. He asked me personal questions that were uncomfortable, made me feel stupid when I asked questions, and overall discouraged me. Do not take english 125 from him.",awful
45881,"I attend his Business and Technical Writing course. Rand humiliates people for not understanding assignments when they ask. Very egotistical, rude to those who need help, very difficult work, hard grader -even on those who are following directions. I highly recommend waiting to take this class from anyone else. Not worth losing points on your GPA.",awful
45881,"He was a very hard grader, but he graded on improvement throughout the semester, not on how great of a  greater you were (I mean he obviously graded on how good of a writer you were, but it was more on how much you progressed). I learned a lot from him. I am even taking me next english class with him. Definitely take his course if you can!",awesome
45881,"Professor Steven Rand is very unclear and grades very hard. If you are in his English classes, drop if you want something less than a C. He hates that 'students were graded too easy in high school' so in response to that, he likes to fail his students.",poor
45881,"He is terrible! If you have him drop him IMMEDIATELY! He is mean, and an extremely hard grader!!!!",awful
45881,"Awful. Horrible grading.",awful
45881,"I wish I could give him a zero",awful
45881,"Not good.",poor
45881,"This was a tough class. I expected all college classes to be like this, but since most are not it was somewhat refreshing to have a professor push me this much. If you are willing to put in the work for Mr. Rand you will reep the benefits. If not, then take this class from someone else.",awesome
45881,"He is a unruly professor. He grades on how he feels your ideas are. There is never a right answer, papers can ALWAYS use improvement. I would not recommend him to anyone wanting a grade over a C, even to get that you must put in an excessive amount of time into each paper.",poor
45881,"He is confusing in every aspect: in lecture, in assignments and in critiquing. His assignments are mundane and never change.  I expected to explore writing and become better.  He is an impossible grader, espcially because he grades on how HE feels about your ideas, not on grammer or content.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.",poor
45881,"Worst teacher I have had at UND. Sorry I don't have a PhD in English. His grading style is way too rough for a 125 class. nobody in my class has an A. I have put in 3x more hours for this class than any other but still this class is my worst grade. If possible, avoid this teacher!",poor
45881,"worst experience of my life. expects way too much for a 100 level course. take this class if you want to spend 15 hours on a three page paper and still get a C-. ridiculous grading policies.",average
45881,"For as much of a waste as UNIV 101 is, he did an ok job at keeping things interesting.  Avoid UNIV 101 altogether if you can.",good
45881,"His expectations are high for a required 100-level class, especially since most who take it aren't English majors. To his credit, he's smart and gives good feedback. I wouldn't recommend him to a freshman.",good
45881,"Steven rand just a joke!! and so incrediablely socially awkward! do not take this class unless you like to fail out of college! He gives you directions for a paper but grades on whatever is on his mind that day his grading makes no sense and no one has ever gotten an A in one of his classes yet.... if you dont believe me he will tell you this.",awful
45881,"I struggled through his class. First- he's a lawyer, so he'll lead you on making you think one thing without actually promising anything.  Second- he'll give you about 20 different instructions on one paper and he'll grade it by how he's feeling. Stupid class, I worked so hard and managed a B but he told me that I had &quot;weak writing.&quot; Avoid him!",awful
45881,"Hey be nice. Yeah, he's hard to understand, and a very harsh grader, but he's a teacher and at least he's doing his job (of course, everyone including me would love easier, more comprehendable classes) just be greatful he's willing to put up with everyone's bull hoping that he helped at least one student improve in literature.",good
45881,"Stevevn Rand was the absolute worst professor i have ever had.  He's without a doubt the hardest teacher you can take for any english classes.  He grades extremely hard, and not at the level of a 100 class. Also Steven Rand is the biggest &quot;Creeper&quot; he makes everyone around him feel extremely uncomfortable.",poor
45881,"This is the hardest 100 level class ever. It doesn't matter if you dedicate your life to this class, you still won't get an A! Take it a another semester or with a different professor. His directions are unclear. He goes against everything the book says, but tells you to use the book.  He's confusing, a hard grader, and a different guy. STAY AWAY!!",poor
45881,"I am currently in this class.  I took this, because I was told it was supposed to be easier than 120.  I regret staying in this class with Rand as my Professor.  He is nice and pretty smart, but his grading is ridiculous.  He is the hardest grader I have ever encountered.DONT take him, if you are taking this class as a general basically. LISTEN.",average
45881,"I took 125 because I heard it was easier than 120 unless you get a certain professor. Well this is that professor. He's a nice guy but expects perfection and is out of touch with reality. The class is boring and hard, and the book is expensive. First paper was 3-4 pages, last will be 15 with each in between getting larger. Would NOT recommend him.",poor
45881,"This was by far the best learning experience I have had at UND. He is a hard grader but he helps by marking your papers with serious suggestions. I feel that many mistake his marks for personal attacks when he is only trying to bring the best out in his students. My writing skills have improved a hundred fold. I would recommend him to anyone.",awesome
45881,"I should have read these comments before I took this class. This was by far the worse teacher I have had! He makes you feel dumb and expects way to much for a 100 level class. Worked my butt off to get a B in the course! If you can, please switch to another teacher, you will be thankful you did!! He expects everyone is an English Major!",awful
45881,"I suggest never taking him...i read the comments on here but figured it wouldnt be so bad so stayed in...wrong move...trust me..get out of the class ASAP...his instructions were never clear and he made you write the paper then changed his assignment my advice for the writers group is to just write a bunch of crap because you'll rewrite it anyway",awful
45881,"No Comments",awful
45881,"horrible teacher, i had to transfer out of state i hated this guy so much",awful
45881,"He was a very unfair teacher... i suggest NOT taking him!",awful

45881,"I think he is a great guy to just talk about music, and fun stuff outside of school, but he never answers questions you have, and gives like a couple B's in the class the rest...  you know...",poor
45881,"what can i say about rand....those of you who hate him so much should be lucky that you didn't have to endure his class five days a week for six weeks for an hour and a half each day....YOU SHOULD FEEL SOMEWHAT LUCKY!",awful
45881,"This man is the devil trapped in human form. It is currently 2:42am the day before this final paper and I want to gouge my eyes out. If I could give some advice to future students I would recommend dropping at the soonest possible moment and save yourself some time before drop day or prepare to spend 8 hours writing papers to get a C-.I despise him",awful
45881,"Impossible to a get above a C- on anything!!! He treats you like you are an employee of a Rocket science nasa program or something......Nice guy but a lil out of touch with reality",poor
45881,"he sucks...and he wants you to fail at life...stay away.. far away...",awful
45881,"It is impossible to get a good grade.  If you get a B, congradulations, i think you're a first. he is an unfair grader.  I went to the writing center when he worked and had him look at my paper, made all the changes he told me to do and still go a C.  I spent way too much time on his papers.  If you have him, get out now!!!!!!",awful

601915,"The course is difficult, but doable. Mr. Farm will help you, but the key to this course is to use  math learning center. He is a professor that wants to see you pass so he tries to help as much as possible.",good
601915,"Everyday there is a WebAssign assignment given out (very time consuming and they don't help you on the exams). The three exams he gives are extremely HARD!, all I can say is just practice ... a lot. I got a F on my first exam and had to ace the rest to get an A overall. lastly, the final will wreck you, the girl sitting next to me cried during it.",poor
601915,"Mr. Farm is one of the nicest people you will meet. WebAssign assignments get handed out every day after class to practice problems and a quiz usually appears every day at class. Do a lot of practice questions for the 3 midterm tests. For the final he makes you understand the concepts instead of memorizing problems. Put the work in, get an A.",good
601915,"Tests are hard because they never matched up with notes and lectures. On the final test, we had to get a 70% on it or we didn't pass the Everything that you think is gonna be on the test, is not. Expect homework 4 days a week. Would not recommend.",awful
601915,"Mr. Farm is the best math teacher I have ever had. He is super funny and very passionate about what he does. There is a quiz almost every day in class, but it is not the end of the world if you miss one.",awesome

Also, there is a quiz in class pretty much every day, so go! The homework is challenging and time consuming, but the tests are much easier which is nice. He isn't the best at explaining material, but ok.",average
601915,"Terrible teacher all around. Had him my first year in college for math and got stuck with him again my junior year and nothing changed.. he maybe even got worse..",poor
601915,"Nice person but absolutely sucks at teaching math. This class is supposed to be for students who are below the average math scores but he makes it so difficult. I'm bad at math to start with and he doesn't help. Avoid him at all costs.",awful
601915,"I took Math 92 and 93 in one semester, it was very fast paced. If you missed any class you would be behind for a while. All in all he was a good teacher, I think a lot of people didn't like moving at that pace and in turn disliked him.",average
601915,"Took this class for interest, also was the first math course in College. It was very hard to start with, extensive and new HW every class(Webassign), Prepare to do them, with solid understanding. attendence are vital. Test are very based on in class assignments and lecture examples.",good
601915,"Farm has homework almost nightly, but it nothing that wasn't able to be done quickly for the most part.  His final test accounted for the most percentage of the points in the class so studying is mandatory if you want to pass this class.",good
601915,"If you don't show your work or show that you double checked your answers he'll give you a zero, even if you got the question right.  Also you can't skip because he does in class practice that you turn in at the end of the class.",awful

601915,"Kinda quirky but he's a good guy that cares. Show up everyday for free points. Quizzes almost every week (turned into group quizzes by the end of the semester). Test very similar to quizzes. Homework almost every day and it is much harder than what you will see on the quizzes/test though if you ask for extensions you'll get it every time. Math On!",awesome
601915,"Kind of weird, makes corny jokes all the time but one of the better math professors I've had. He's passionate about the subject and it shows. He spends extra time making sure that his students understand the reasons behind why you do certain steps and, for me, it was helpful in my understanding. Recommended.",good
601915,"This class is  a giant headache. So far, we've had over 30 assignments(only worth 20% of grade) that each take hours to complete, because Stuart puts many problems that we never went over in class . On top of that, we have weekly comprehensive quizzes that are inconsistent in difficulty and points. Simply, I pity anyone who has to take this class.",poor
601915,"I would not recommend this professor if you' re not strong in math. You should expect to do homework almost every night. New homework assignment after each class. Doesn't give traditional exams but weekly quizzes for points. Text book assigned was of little help. Homework take hours to complete for only small portion of grade.",average
601915,"Stuart Farm, so far, has been the worst professor I have had. He grades so harshly that it is almost impossible to get even a C. (At one point I had a 48%) (& Im the average A/B student) He gives weekly quizzes and gives time consuming homework. I would not recommend him.",poor
601915,"He is the worst teacher that I have had for the past ten years. He goes way overboard with trying to explain things, and when he does explain things, it doesn't show up on the test or quizzes. There are many other students in my class that have no idea what is going on. Don't take any of his classes. You have to teach yourself the lessons.",poor
601915,"Stuart Farm is a fantastic guy that is very easy to get along with. Greets you with a smile every day and is excited to see you each and every day and tries to make the class fun. Defenitly introduce yourself to him. He is confusing in his explaining of concepts. He tends to over-explain where it gets confusing. He is a very respectable person.",average
601915,"Stuart Farm is a nice guy and cares about his students, but that doesn't result in effective teaching or keeping the class engaged. He doesn't seem to understand that students taking Math146 are the least likely to raise there hand and contribute, and you can't have a discussion with 100 people. For grades, watch him like a hawk and email him ASAP.",poor
601915,"Mr. Farm is a good teacher, but is not quite clear on the types of questions we need to go over. The homework and in-class assignments are a lot tougher than the actual exams.",good
601915,"Mr. Farm was a nice guy and tried to make everyone laugh. But points wise I had an A, because of his curve I had a C. He never explained anything and if you asked him a question he never seemed to answer it. I would avoid taking his class, unless you want to fail. ",poor
601915,"Professor Farm is a nice guy and wants you to do well, but he is very confusing. Avoid him if possible. I took Math93 with him, and although it's very simple math, he makes if somehow difficult. I hadn't had math since my junior year of high school, so I had to take this. His explanations make things more difficult. Have to teach yourself. ",average

Gave me multiple zero's on test problems for not doing the question 'his way' even thought the answer was correct. ",awful
601915,"Mr. Farm knows math and he wants you to learn.  Don't expect him to just give you the answers. He will answer any and every question and clarify anything you need.  Attend class, do the assignments and you'll do fine.  Gives 2 tests (10 questions each) and final (15 questions). Super nice, nerdy guy who's motto is 'Math on!' ",good
601915,"Terrible at teaching, absolutely no help when asking questions, and was rude to his own students.",awful
601915,"Mr. Farm is in the top 3 of the worst teachers I have ever had. He assigns work that you did not cover on web assign (the worst way to do math homework). He is not very helpful, and is very odd. Avoid this professor at all costs, he will make an easy subject hard to comprehend.",awful
601915,"Like others have said, he seems like a great guy, and is very willing to help his students.  That said, he spends most of every lecture period answering questions from current or previous assignments and then only lectures on new material for 10 min.  So I basically have had to teach myself the material which makes it super tough and time consuming",average
601915,"Is a very nice teacher, but hard to understand his lectures. He expects you to know too much coming into the class, and goes far over the students head's while lecturing.

I could not understand anything he was teaching. My girlfriend didn't even know and she was in calc 2. Over taught everything beyond most of the class' knowledge. ",poor
601915,"Mr. Farm is hands down just not clear in any area of the classes he teaches. It seems that there is about a 5050 split between students who get what he is teaching and those who don't. I would not recommend taking a class with him.",poor

Attendance is not required but helps a lot!",awesome

601915,"He tries to crack jokes during class form time to time, some funny some others not so. His notes are a little random and not so in-depth, but he is very willing to work with you in and out side of class! Don't be afraid to ask questions!!! His tests can be easy if you study and they are not take home tests!",average
601915,"Dorky at times but a good teacher",good
601915,"Stuart Farm was a nice enough guy, but that gets you nowhere with teaching. His lectures are all over the place and do not relate to the online assignments at all. His lectures are scattered, covering things randomly and unevenly, and he goes through material way too fast. I would not recommend him as a teacher.",poor
601915,"I get an absolute kick out of this guy in class! He has such a weird sense of humor, but it is still funny as heck! But on another note, he isn't really that good of a teacher. Doesn't do examples in class that help with homework, and pretty much told us that we will not need our book at all, which sucks because of how much the book costs. =/",average
601915,"Lectures had nothing to do with the online assignments.  Notes were not helpful at all.  Basically taking a class with no teacher. Probably better off just trying to learn from the book and skipping class.  Switched sections after week and a half",poor
601915,"I've only been in his class for a week and I hate it! I used to love going to math class he just makes it frustrating! Lectures have nothing to do with online assignments, his notes don't even make sense, and he doesn't put any examples into action so your always clueless! Goes through things way to fast as well! Waste of my hard earned money!",poor
601915,"I really like Stuart as a person, but not as a teacher. His lectures were a lot different than the homework and the notes weren't very useful. He is hard to follow, but he will make time outside of class if extra help is needed.",average
601915,"He is a really nice guy and is willing to answer any questions, but he is terrible at teaching lectures!! The reason why I always needed to ask for help is because he would never really show how to do the problems. He went way too fast, even though he says he'll slow it down until people understand. Very frustrating!!",average
601915,"While he was very enthusiastic about Math, (which I appreciated), he was also very insistent that everyone understood everything quickly, without time to really practice what we had just learned. Disappointing when he knew over half of the class was going to fail, then didn't bother to help.",average
601915,"Horrible, he explains math and compares it to Star Wars. Tries to explain things too fast and he is just not understandable.",awful
601915,"Very hard to understand.  Would NOT reccomend him unless you are good at teaching yourself.  I went to class everyday and still did not understand it because he does not teach good.",awful
601915,"I thought Mr. Farm was an excellent PreCalculus instructor.  One of the best math teachers I've had.  He does a great job at explaining the concepts and providing examples on the blackboard.  Also, I thought he was mildly entertaining and has a friendly demeanor, which never hurts.",awesome
601915,"Wonderful teacher in office hours but terrible in class. I believe the chalk board learned more than anyone in the class.",average
601915,"HE TRYS HARD TO HELP AND TEACH US, BUT. HIS WAY OF EXPAINING THINGS IS,..... UNCLEAR AND HARD TO FOLLOW. I BELIVE THE ONLY WAY TO UNDERSTAND MR. FARM IS TO HAVE PREVIOUSLY TAKEN THIS CLASS WITH A DIFFRENT PROFESSOR",average
601915,"cannot get his point across, is very confusing, puts all the trick questions on the tests and makes it difficult for students.Would not recommended him to any one.",poor
601915,"He is very helpful if you don't understand the topic. Sometimes the tests can be tricky but if you go in for his office hours he is more than happy to explain the concepts for you.",awesome
601915,"TERRIBLE. Absolutley hated his class. He just assumes everyone understands the information and never asks if you actually get it or not. Also he moves really fast through the material which can be a bad thing when he sucks at teaching it.",poor
601915,"Avoid! At the start of the semester I looked at this site on him and it was a 1.9 I didn't think much of it I figured just as long as I show up to class and do the work I will do fine. Well I did all of that and I studied many many hours before tests and it never paid off. What Im trying to say is that Farm makes the class harder than it should be.",poor
601915,"Along with everyone else, he's the worst teacher I have ever had. He pretty much just talks to himself the whole period and doesn't ask if anyone gets it. He sometimes talks to period marks on the board. The most awkward guy I know!",awful

601915,"This guy is terrible he teaches the class harder than its supposed to be. Your better off paying the $600 bucks and taking it online. Do not take him at all. Trust me if you want to pass, he is not the guy. He just rambles on and doesn't stop to explain things. I highly advise you not to listen to the comments from nerds saying how good he is.",awful
601915,"Best math teacher I've ever had.  He's really helpful and accomodating.  Hes also really easy to talk to, dont hesitate to go talk to him about problems on a test.  If you go to class regularly, take notes and DO the homework, there is absolutly no reason you shouldnt get an A.",awesome
601915,"Terrible teacher. I will not ever take a class from him again. his grading is so unfair. dont ever think you can take a class and get a grade you deserve from farm",poor

601915,"Worst teacher I have ever had my whole entire life!He cant teach at all.I went in for extra help,which was the most useless wasted hours of my life.His tests are rediculous-no partial credit given.You either get the 5 points or you get none. How can a question be worth 5 points, and if you get it wrong, you get none&#63;Where do the 5 points come from&#63;",awful

601915,"Although nice, and somewhat approachable, his teaching methods are very hard to learn from. He also gives extremely long and hard exams, which most of the class fails. The class average four our first exam was an F. I would not recommend this class for anyone who wants a good grade, or has a hard time teaching themselves math.",poor
601915,"I don't see why everyone has such a problem with him.  I like his teaching style and you learn quite a bit from it.  Take the class from him if you actually want to learn and not fall behind for the next Calc class.  He's helpful and accomodating after class also..",good

He said his tests are a measure of real life therefore he dosen't curve. So does this mean that the average person is failing in life like they are on his tests&#63;",awful

601915,"Not a bad teacher, although I did not enjoy the lame jokes and teaching style. I never went to the class and passed, 102 being a pass fail class saved me. no need to attend class because he never gives pop quizes as long as you study hard on your own. I learned more through the book",average

71357,"I would not consider this class a sociology class. This felt more like just information on drugs and did not talk about it sociologically. It was still a good class, a lot harder than any other class by Frank White. Online quizzes for every test which are easy. You cannot skip this class ever.",good

71357,"Frank's easily one of the best professors at UND and goes out of his way to get to know his students. Knows all the course content extremely well, and keeps you engaged the whole time. Some of his stories are awesome. Do the memory matrices, crosswords, and study guides and you'll easily pass. Go to class because his powerpoints are fill in.",awesome

71357,"Frank White is the BEST professor at UND. He can turn the most boring topic into something that you're literally on the edge of your seat to hear. He's extremely knowledgeable and up-to-date on his material, genuinely cares about his students, and takes the time to get to know them. He's got a great sense of humor  and is well respected by everyone",awesome

71357,"Frank is one of the best teachers at UND. It's sad that he's now done with the big lecture classes, because otherwise I'd highly recommend you take them. Intro to Soc. was extremely easy anyway, but he made going to class fun and that made the class awesome.",awesome
71357,"Most interesting prof. I've ever had. Even if you're not interested in the material his lectures will get you listening. Attendance is pretty much required with easy daily quizzes but it was honestly never a struggle to convince myself to go to this class. Definitely take at least one class from him.",awesome

71357,"AMAZING professor. He is the reason I switched my major to Sociology. Always attend class because he does not put notes online. If you can, bring your laptop for notes. He jumps around a lot and fills in things he missed during his lecture so it's easiest to use your computer and he doesn't use powerpoint.",awesome
71357,"Very interesting, has stories for everything. Doesn't use powerpoint which makes class much more interactive but make sure to take notes because most of the exam is based off of class. Best professor I've had at UND and very approachable",awesome

He is very funny and entertaining. you have to attend class or you wont have the notes for the tests which are 70% off of lecture notes. the other 30% is from the book which you have to read. he gives a study guide which is very helpful.",awesome
71357,"He is definitely the best professor I have had so far. He is really funny and personable and makes the class interesting. But, you need to go to class to get the notes because he doesnt put them up on blackboard and most of the test is based off lecture. Easy A if you go.",awesome

71357,"Very passionate in his lecture, and likes to make the class laugh.  he always talks to people before class starts just to see how their day is going.  The only negative is that he does not use powerpoints so you have to write everything down.  He talks very fast too, so either learn how to type/write quickly.",good
71357,"Good teacher but my only complaints are he doesnt use powerpoint slides or post notes on blackboard so you have to write down everything he says and he talks fast & rambles a lot.Make friends in the class because if you miss a day you will need to get the notes from them or else you won't do that well on the tests. Do the study guides as well.",awesome
